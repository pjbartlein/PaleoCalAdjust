**Figure 1.** Variations over the past 150 kyr in the beginning and
ending days of ﬁxed-angular months for a 365 d *noleap* calendar, shown
for 1 kyr intervals beginning at 0 ka (1950 CE). The left side of each
horizontal bar shows the beginning day, while the right side shows the
ending day of a particular month for each 1 kyr interval. The
month-length "anomalies" or differences from the present day are shown
by shading, with individual paleo months that are shorter than those at
present indicated by green shades and those that are longer indicated by
blue shades. The day that perihelion occurs for each 1 kyr interval is
indicated by a magenta dot, and the overall pattern of month-length
anomalies can be seen to follow the day of perihelion. The ﬁgure shows
that the changing month lengths move the beginning, middle, and ending
days of each month (as well as the beginning and ending days of the
year). The day of the Northern Hemisphere summer solstice is indicated
by a black diamond on the x axes.

**Figure 2.** Variations in the difference (in days) between the
mid-month day of each month and the day of the June solstice. Months
that are shifted closer to the June solstice are indicated by orange
hues, while those that are farther away are indicated by blue. As in
Fig. 1, variations over the past 150 kyr in the beginning and ending
days of ﬁxed-angular months for a 365 d *noleap* calendar are shown for
1 kyr intervals beginning at 0 ka (1950 CE). The left side of each
horizontal bar shows the beginning day, while the right side shows the
ending day of a particular month for each 1 kyr interval. Variations in
the beginning and ending days of individual months can be seen to track
the climatic precession parameter (e · sin ω, where e is eccentricity
and ω is the longitude of perihelion measured from the vernal equinox,
an index of Earth's distance from the Sun at the summer solstice), which
is plotted at the right side of the ﬁgure (red dots). (Note that the
inverse of the climatic precession parameter is plotted for easier
comparison.) The day of the Northern Hemisphere summer solstice is
indicated by a black diamond on the x axes.

**Figure 3.** Calendar effects on insolation at 45° N. The differences
plotted show the values of average daily insolation at mid-month days
identiﬁed using the appropriate ﬁxed-angular paleo calendar minus those
using the ﬁxed-length deﬁnition of present-day months, with orange hues
showing positive differences and purple hues negative differences. As in
Fig. 1, variations over the past 150 kyr in the beginning and ending
days of ﬁxed-angular months for a 365 d *noleap* calendar are shown for
1 kyr intervals beginning at 0 ka (1950 CE). The left side of each
horizontal bar shows the beginning day, while the right side shows the
ending day of a particular month for each 1 kyr interval.

**Figure 4.** Calendar effects on insolation at the Equator. The
differences plotted show the values of average daily insolation at
mid-month days identiﬁed using the appropriate ﬁxed-angular paleo
calendar minus those using the ﬁxed-length deﬁnition of present-day
months, with orange hues showing positive differences and purple hues
negative differences. As in Fig. 1, variations over the past 150 kyr in
the beginning and ending days of ﬁxed-angular months for a 365 d
*noleap* calendar are shown for 1 kyr intervals beginning at 0 ka (1950
CE). The left side of each horizontal bar shows the beginning day, while
the right side shows the ending day of a particular month for each 1 kyr
interval.

**Figure 5.** Calendar effects on insolation at 45° S. The differences
plotted show the values of average daily insolation at mid-month days
identiﬁed using the appropriate ﬁxed-angular paleo calendar minus those
using the ﬁxed-length deﬁnition of present-day months, with orange hues
showing positive differences and purple hues negative differences. As in
Fig. 1, variations over the past 150 kyr in the beginning and ending
days of ﬁxed-angular months for a 365 d *noleap* calendar are shown for
1 kyr intervals beginning at 0 ka (1950 CE). The left side of each
horizontal bar shows the beginning day, while the right side shows the
ending day of a particular month for each 1 kyr interval.

**Figure 6.** Orbital parameter variations at 1 kyr intervals over the
past 150 kyr for obliquity, climatic precession, eccentricity, and day
of perihelion (relative to 1 January). Climatic precession is calculated
as e · sin ω, where e is eccentricity and ω is the longitude of
perihelion measured from the vernal equinox.

the beginning and ending days of ﬁxed-angular months for a 365 d
*noleap* calendar are shown for 1 kyr intervals beginning at 0 ka (1950
CE). The left side of each horizontal bar shows the beginning day, while

**Figure 10.** Present-day (1981-2010 CE) long-term mean values of
monthly near-surface air temperature (*tas*) from the Climate Forecast
System Reanalysis (CFSR), the mean temperatures of the warmest (MTWA)
and coldest (MTCO) months and their differences from the same data, and
precipitation rate (*precip*) from the CPC Merged Analysis of
Precipitation (CMAP).

**Figure 11.** Calendar effects on near-surface air temperature for 6 ka
(**a**), 97 ka (**b**), 127 ka (**c**), and 116 ka (**d**). The maps
show the patterns of month-length adjusted average temperatures minus
the unadjusted values using 1981-2010 long-term averages of CFSR tas
values, with positive differences (indicating that the adjusted data
would be warmer than unadjusted data) in red hues and negative-

**Figure 14.** Time series of original and month-length adjusted annual
area-weighted averages of TraCE-21ka data (Liu et al., 2009), expressed
as differences from the 1961-1989 long-term mean for (**a-c**) 2 m air
temperature, (**d**) precipitation rate, and (**e-f**) precipitation
minus evaporation (*P* - *E*). The original or unadjusted data are
plotted in gray and black, and the adjusted data are in color. The area
averages are grid-cell area-weighted values for land grid points in each
region, and the smoother curves are locally weighted regression curves
with a window half-width of 100 years. The regions are deﬁned as (**a**)
15 to 75° N and −170 to 60° E, (**b**) 10 to 50° S and 110 to 160° E,
(**c**) global ice-free land area, (**d**) 0 to 30° N and −30 to 120° E,
(**e**) 5 to 17° N and −5 to 30° E, and (**f**) 31 to 43° N and −5 to
30° E.

**Figure 15.** Pseudo-daily interpolated temperature (**a, b**) and
precipitation (**c, d**) for some representative locations: (**a, c**)
Madison, Wisconsin, USA, (**b**) Australia, and (**d**) the Indian
Ocean. The original monthly mean data are shown by the black dots and
stepped curves (black lines), daily values linearly interpolated between
the monthly mean values are shown in blue, and daily values using the
mean-preserving approach of Epstein (1991) are shown in red. The annual
interpolation error (or the difference between the annual average
calculated using the original data and the pseudo-daily interpolated
data) is given for the mean-preserving approach in each case. The
interpolated data for this ﬁgure were generated using the program
`demo_01_pseudo_daily_interp.f90`.

**Figure 16.** Pseudo-daily interpolation errors for CFSR near-surface
air temperature (**a, c**) and CMAP precipitation rate (**b, d**). (**a,
b**) The interpolation errors, or the differences between the original
monthly mean values and the monthly mean values recalculated from linear
interpolation of pseudo-daily values. (**c, d**) The interpolation
errors for mean-preserving (Epstein, 1991) interpolation. The errors for
linear interpolation of the temperature data (°C) range from −1.20851 to
1.29904, with a mean of 0.05664 and standard deviation of 0.16129 (over
all months and grid points), while those for mean-preserving
interpolation range from −0.00002 to 0.00050, with a mean of −0.0061 and
standard deviation of 0.00007. The errors for linear interpolation of
the precipitation data (mm d<sup>−1</sup>) range from −1.10617 to 1.40968, with a
mean of 0.00087 and standard deviation of 0.11851, while those for
mean-preserving interpolation range from −0.00002 to 0.00383, with a
mean of 0.00001 and standard deviation of 0.00163.
